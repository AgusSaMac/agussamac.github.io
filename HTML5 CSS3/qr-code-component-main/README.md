## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Normalize.css](https://styled-components.com/) - For explorer cross- compatibility.
- [Outfit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) - font family.



### What I learned

I learned how to set the maximum height of the webpage in accordance with the monitor height.

I reinforced my learning on the use of a flexbox and the BEM approach to code CSS.

### Continued development

I need to focus on learning more about the posible values diferent attributes can use. As I had to resort to a websearch to find how to set the monitor maximum height.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Guide](https://flaviocopes.com/flexbox/) - This site helped me to better understand how flexbox works and how its attributes work.
- [Choose CSS Units](https://getflywheel.com/layout/choose-css-unit-create-better-site-layouts-how-to/) - Article describing the types of units available. As a newbie this was a Godsend as I am still learning the basics. (05/07/22)
