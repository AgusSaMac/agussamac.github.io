## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)

### What I learned

This challenge allowed me to practice the usage of CSS Flexbox, CSS Grid and the transform property to give some focus to elements like the buy button and the image, 

I had to create two grids inside the already designated flexbox to properly set the elements inside the card. 

### Continued development

I'm still unsure about the use of responsive text, need to research more about it.

### Useful resources

- [Responsive Text](https://dev.to/laurilllll/how-to-create-responsive-typography-using-css-three-different-methods-explained-50f8) - Here I found some ideas for making the text responsive.
- [Stretch child element height to fill parent](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5581799/how-to-stretch-div-height-to-fill-parent-div-css) - This stack overflow question helped me fill the card on the side of the product description when the design changed.
