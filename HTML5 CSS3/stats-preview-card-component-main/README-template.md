## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Normalize](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)

### What I learned

I have spent some time away from coding specially as I am learning, so this challenge was a perfect challenge to get back to it, I really think I did a good job on it.


### Continued development

I wanted to input some javascript on this project but I decided against it in the end to remember how to use SASS, On my next projects I may try work with javascript. For the moment I wont work with any framework for it so I can center myself in learning pure javascript.
